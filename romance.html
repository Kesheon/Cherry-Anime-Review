      <p id="fivecmpersecondPARAGRAPH">Genre: Romance, Slice of Life<br><br>5cm Per Second is most definitely a 10/10 rating. The movie is named 5 Centimeters Per<br><br> Second for the speed at which cherry blossom petals fall, petals being a metaphorical<br><br> representation of humans, reminiscent of the slowness of life and how people often start<br><br> together but slowly drift into their separate ways. It is a story centered around the lives of a<br><br> boy named Takaki and a girl named Akari. Up to Elementary school, these two got along well<br><br> and promised to be together forever, as they were the best of friends. However, by middle<br><br> school, Akari switches schools. Being young and naive, the two believe they will still be<br><br> together forever despite the distance between them. As they grow older, from middle school<br><br> age into adult hood, they grow further and further apart, life cirumstances and the world<br><br> itself seems to be against their love/ childhood promise of being together forever. They cope<br><br> with the loneliness and distance in entirely different ways. </p>

      <p id="iwteypPARAGRAPH">Genre: Romance, Tragedy, Slice of Life<br><br> Do not let the title of this anime prevent you from watching it. It is a definite 10/10 rating.<br><br> This story follows two high school students who are polar opposites of one anoter. Haruki is a<br><br> young man who closes himself off from others and cares very little, if it all, for others. Haruki<br><br> prefers to bury his head in books rather than interact with others. Sakura is a young woman<br><br> who attends the same high school as him and she is the exact opposite: she is a ray of<br><br> sunshine around others and doesn't care for reading nearly as much as Haruki. Sakura is<br><br> dying due to some disease in her pancreas, and does not have long to live. Her entire family<br><br> treats her differently knowing that she is soon to die, so Sakura decides to not tell any of her<br><br> friends at school that she is soon going to die. Sakura does this knowing that her friends will<br><br> distance themselves just as her family did upon finding out that she is soon to die. Sakura<br><br> only has her diary to confide in: she just wants people to treat her normally as they used to<br><br> and not have to hide her pancrea disease from anyone. One day at school, Haruki saw that<br><br> Sakura accidentally left her diary behind, so Haruki decided to read a few pages of Sakura's<br><br> diary and discovered that she would soon die. Haruki didn't even believe it to be true. Sakura<br><br> told Haruki that she intended for him to read it and she was glad that Haruki didn't seem to<br><br> think that she was going to die soon. Sakura was glad that Haruki didn't seem to<br><br> think that she was soon to die because she wanted to spend her remaining time with<br><br> someone who would treat her as a normal person for the final days of her life. But as Sakura<br><br> spends time more time with Haruki, Haruki starts to care for her and his concern for her<br><br> health grows greater.</p>
