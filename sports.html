      <p id="haikyuuPARAGRAPH">Genre: Sports, Slice of Life, Drama, Action<br><br> Haikyuu!! Receives an 8/10 rating. This anime has 4 seasons with 90 episodes and it is still<br><br> ongoing. This anime centers around a group of young men who are on their high school's<br><br> volleyball team. Most of the anime you will see the everyday life of high school athletes. If<br><br> you were a high school athlete, you may find yourself taking a liking to this anime just as I<br><br> did: no matter what sport you played! Day in and out they are practicing and having to do<br><br> their best academically as well. Problems arise such as team members getting injured right<br><br> before a big game, team members not getting along, some team members do not make the<br><br> best life-choices, and many other "coming of age"/ athlete/ everyday high school student<br><br> problems. This anime receives an 8/10 rating because at times it will seem slow/boring. This<br><br> is because it is centering around high school students. Yes, most of it will be a fun watch<br><br> since it is a mixture of action and "coming of age" drama, but there are quieter times that are<br><br> not as interesting, such as the team members hanging out after school, doing chores, being<br><br> with family, and so on.</p>

      <li><h4>Hajime no Ippo (2000- 2014)</h4><br><br></li>

      <p id="hajimePARAGRAPH">Genre: Sports, Action, Drama, Slice of Life<br><br> 8/10 rating. Overall, ‘Hajime no Ippo’ is a well-rounded anime that has a combination of<br><br> some epic fight scenes that will get you all hyped up, heart-touching moments that will make<br><br> you sad for a while and most of all, a very motivating overarching plot that’ll make your heart<br><br> swell with joy. Makunouchi Ippo is an ordinary high school student in Japan. Since he spends<br><br> most of his time away from school helping his mother run the family business, he doesn't get<br><br> to enjoy his younger years like most teenagers. Always a target for bullying at school (the<br><br> family fishing business grants him a distinct odor), Ippo's life is one of hardship. One of these<br><br> after-school bullying sessions turns Ippo's life around for the better, as he is saved by a boxer<br><br> named Takamura. He decides to follow in Takamura's footsteps and train to become a boxer,<br><br> giving his life direction and purpose. Ippo's path to perfecting his pugilistic prowess is just<br><br> beginning.</p>
