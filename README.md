This is a website in which I give my opinionated review on animated television shows. It has a welcome page, a page in which I review the actual animated tv shows alongside pictures and video trailers, a dropdown menu on the navbar titled, "Review by Genre" so that you can search for my reviews of a tv show by genre, and a link on the navbar that opens my email for you to send feedback to me regarding my website.
