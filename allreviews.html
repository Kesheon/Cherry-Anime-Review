      <p id="fivecmpersecondPARAGRAPH">Genre: Romance, Slice of Life<br><br>5cm Per Second is most definitely a 10/10 rating. The movie is named 5 Centimeters Per<br><br> Second for the speed at which cherry blossom petals fall, petals being a metaphorical<br><br> representation of humans, reminiscent of the slowness of life and how people often start<br><br> together but slowly drift into their separate ways. It is a story centered around the lives of a<br><br> boy named Takaki and a girl named Akari. Up to Elementary school, these two got along well<br><br> and promised to be together forever, as they were the best of friends. However, by middle<br><br> school, Akari switches schools. Being young and naive, the two believe they will still be<br><br> together forever despite the distance between them. As they grow older, from middle school<br><br> age into adult hood, they grow further and further apart, life cirumstances and the world<br><br> itself seems to be against their love/ childhood promise of being together forever. They cope<br><br> with the loneliness and distance in entirely different ways. </p>

      <li><h4>A Silent Voice (2016)</h4><br><br></li>

      <p id="asilentvoicePARAGRAPH">Genre: Slice of Life, Tragedy, Romance<br><br>A Silent Voice, produced by Kyoto animations, recieves a 10/10 rating. Though the movie has<br><br> many characters, some we hate, others we love, the story centers around Ishida Shouya and<br><br> Nishimiya Shouko. Nishimiya Shouko is a deaf elementary student who found herself being<br><br> bullied by her classmates: mainly Ishida Shouya. Despite Nishimiya getting bullied by<br><br> everyone, she goes out of her way to always put on a smile and tries to befriend everyone<br><br> despite communication barriers: especially Ishida Shouya. When Nishimiya Shouko's parents<br><br> get in contact with teachers, the bullying is addressed. This is where the tables turn. Despite<br><br> everyone in the classroom bullying Nishimiya Shouko, everyone puts the blame on Ishida<br><br> Shouya. Ishida Shouya was beyond shocked to discover that the people whom he thought<br><br> were his friends, had suddenly turned on him, instead of them all taking the blame for<br><br> bullying Nishimiya Shouko. From that point forward Ishida Shouya was bullied by everyone<br><br> else except Nishimiya Shouko. But, Ishida Shouya continued to bully Nishimiya Shouko:<br><br> blaming her as the reason as to why he is now getting bullied by everyone. But one day<br><br> Nishimiya Shouko moved away without saying a word to anyone. By the time Ishida Shouya<br><br> is in high school he was no longer being bullied, but he was depressed, isolated from others,<br><br> and had social anxiety. One day in high school he notices that Nishimiya Shouko is<br><br> attending the same high school as him. Ishida Shouya sought to redeem himself in various<br><br> ways. This movie is a visual representation of the roller coaster we call, "coming of age". My<br><br> description does this movie no justice: it is a must watch!!!<p>

      <li><h4>Haikyuu!! (2014 - Ongoing)</h4><br><br></li>

      </video>
      <p id="haikyuuPARAGRAPH">Genre: Sports, Slice of Life, Drama, Action<br><br> Haikyuu!! Receives an 8/10 rating. This anime has 4 seasons with 90 episodes and it is still<br><br> ongoing. This anime centers around a group of young men who are on their high school's<br><br> volleyball team. Most of the anime you will see the everyday life of high school athletes. If<br><br> you were a high school athlete, you may find yourself taking a liking to this anime just as I<br><br> did: no matter what sport you played! Day in and out they are practicing and having to do<br><br> their best academically as well. Problems arise such as team members getting injured right<br><br> before a big game, team members not getting along, some team members do not make the<br><br> best life-choices, and many other "coming of age"/ athlete/ everyday high school student<br><br> problems. This anime receives an 8/10 rating because at times it will seem slow/boring. This<br><br> is because it is centering around high school students. Yes, most of it will be a fun watch<br><br> since it is a mixture of action and "coming of age" drama, but there are quieter times that are<br><br> not as interesting, such as the team members hanging out after school, doing chores, being<br><br> with family, and so on.</p>

      <li><h4>Hajime no Ippo (2000-2014)</h4><br><br></li>

      <p id="hajimePARAGRAPH">Genre: Sports, Action, Drama, Slice of Life<br><br> 8/10 rating. Overall, ‘Hajime no Ippo’ is a well-rounded anime that has a combination of<br><br> some epic fight scenes that will get you all hyped up, heart-touching moments that will make<br><br> you sad for a while and most of all, a very motivating overarching plot that’ll make your heart<br><br> swell with joy. Makunouchi Ippo is an ordinary high school student in Japan. Since he spends<br><br> most of his time away from school helping his mother run the family business, he doesn't get<br><br> to enjoy his younger years like most teenagers. Always a target for bullying at school (the<br><br> family fishing business grants him a distinct odor), Ippo's life is one of hardship. One of these<br><br> after-school bullying sessions turns Ippo's life around for the better, as he is saved by a boxer<br><br> named Takamura. He decides to follow in Takamura's footsteps and train to become a boxer,<br><br> giving his life direction and purpose. Ippo's path to perfecting his pugilistic prowess is just<br><br> beginning.</p>

      <li><h4>I Want to Eat Your Pancreas (2017)</h4><br><br></li>

      <p id="iwteypPARAGRAPH">Genre: Tragedy, Romance, Slice of Life<br><br> Do not let the title of this anime prevent you from watching it. It is a definite 10/10 rating.<br><br> This story follows two high school students who are polar opposites of one anoter. Haruki is a<br><br> young man who closes himself off from others and cares very little, if it all, for others. Haruki<br><br> prefers to bury his head in books rather than interact with others. Sakura is a young woman<br><br> who attends the same high school as him and she is the exact opposite: she is a ray of<br><br> sunshine around others and doesn't care for reading nearly as much as Haruki. Sakura is<br><br> dying due to some disease in her pancreas, and does not have long to live. Her entire family<br><br> treats her differently knowing that she is soon to die, so Sakura decides to not tell any of her<br><br> friends at school that she is soon going to die. Sakura does this knowing that her friends will<br><br> distance themselves just as her family did upon finding out that she is soon to die. Sakura<br><br> only has her diary to confide in: she just wants people to treat her normally as they used to<br><br> and not have to hide her pancrea disease from anyone. One day at school, Haruki saw that<br><br> Sakura accidentally left her diary behind, so Haruki decided to read a few pages of Sakura's<br><br> diary and discovered that she would soon die. Haruki didn't even believe it to be true. Sakura<br><br> told Haruki that she intended for him to read it and she was glad that Haruki didn't seem to<br><br> think that she was going to die soon. Sakura was glad that Haruki didn't seem to<br><br> think that she was soon to die because she wanted to spend her remaining time with<br><br> someone who would treat her as a normal person for the final days of her life. But as Sakura<br><br> spends time more time with Haruki, Haruki starts to care for her and his concern for her<br><br> health grows greater.</p>

      <p id="konPARAGRAPH">Genre: Musical, Slice of Life, Comedy, Drama<br><br> K-ON! is about 5 high school girls who become friends through the Light Music Club. Yui the<br><br> lead guitarist, Tsumugi the keyboardist, Mio the bassist, Azusa the rhythm guitarist, and Ritsu<br><br> the drummer. K-ON is the story of 5 aspiring musicians and their journey through high school<br><br> together. I give this anime an 7.6/10 rating. The music and soundtracks are great and there<br><br> are some very memorable, wholesome moments between these 5 friends.</p>


      <li><h4>ReLIFE (2016)</h4><br><br></li>

Thus, he begins his life as a<br><br>high school student once more.</p>

      <p id="yourlieinaprilPARAGRAPH">Genre: Musical, Tragedy, Slice of Life, Romance, Comedy, Drama<br><br> A definite 10/10 rating. Having so many tagged genres, this anime really is a gem. Anyone<br><br> who likes/is familiar with classical music will LOVE this anime, because that's what it centers<br><br> around. And compared to all the other anime on this list, this anime most definitely has the<br><br> best animation and is the prettiest-looking of them all. This anime is about a piano prodigy<br><br> who lost his ability to play the piano after suffering a traumatic event in his childhood.<br><br> However, years later, he is forced back into the spotlight by an eccentric girl who plays the<br><br> violin. That eccentric girl has a very big secret of her own.</p>
