      <p id="asilentvoicePARAGRAPH">Genre: Slice of Life, Tragedy, Romance<br><br>A Silent Voice, produced by Kyoto animations, recieves a 10/10 rating. Though the movie has<br><br> many characters, some we hate, others we love, the story centers around Ishida Shouya and<br><br> Nishimiya Shouko. Nishimiya Shouko is a deaf elementary student who found herself being<br><br> bullied by her classmates: mainly Ishida Shouya. Despite Nishimiya getting bullied by<br><br> everyone, she goes out of her way to always put on a smile and tries to befriend everyone<br><br> despite communication barriers: especially Ishida Shouya. When Nishimiya Shouko's parents<br><br> get in contact with teachers, the bullying is addressed. This is where the tables turn. Despite<br><br> everyone in the classroom bullying Nishimiya Shouko, everyone puts the blame on Ishida<br><br> Shouya. Ishida Shouya was beyond shocked to discover that the people whom he thought<br><br> were his friends, had suddenly turned on him, instead of them all taking the blame for<br><br> bullying Nishimiya Shouko. From that point forward Ishida Shouya was bullied by everyone<br><br> else except Nishimiya Shouko. But, Ishida Shouya continued to bully Nishimiya Shouko:<br><br> blaming her as the reason as to why he is now getting bullied by everyone. But one day<br><br> Nishimiya Shouko moved away without saying a word to anyone. By the time Ishida Shouya<br><br> is in high school he was no longer being bullied, but he was depressed, isolated from others,<br><br> and had social anxiety. One day in high school he notices that Nishimiya Shouko is<br><br> attending the same high school as him. Ishida Shouya sought to redeem himself in various<br><br> ways. This movie is a visual representation of the roller coaster we call, "coming of age". My<br><br> description does this movie no justice: it is a must watch!!!<p>

Thus, he begins his life as a<br><br>high school student once more.</p>
